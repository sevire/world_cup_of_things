# World Cup Of things

A website to allow users to run a World Cup style competition with friends to determine what is the best thing in a given category.

The idea for this website came out of the Covid Lockdown in 2020. Myself, family and friends ran a number of World Cup Of type competitions, such as the World's Cutest Animal, The World's Best Film.  We did it from a spreadsheet and notes, and it was quite tricky to keep track of the details.  It was great fun and was a way for us all to stay in touch and be distracted from the challenges of lockdown.

A user will be allowed to create a new world cup competition with a given category.  They can add their friends or members of a group or whoever they like to join the competition as a player.  Players will initially be allowed to add items under the category which will be the competitors.  Once the competitors have been chosen the competition will begin.

The competition comprises Matches - which are one competitor against another.  The Players will vote for which competitor they want to win and the competitor with the most votes will win.

There (usually) will be a group stage and a knockout stage.

In the group stage the competitors are allocated to a group.  Typically a group will comprise 6-8 competitors.  Within a group, each competitor will play each other competitor, and the winnder will be allocated points.  Each round in the group stage is a collection of matches from each group.

At the end of the Group stage certain items will be elminated and the remainder will go through to the knockout stage.

In the knockout stage, each round will pair an item with another one, and the winner meets the winner or the corresponding match.  This continues until we get to a quarter final, semi-final and then a final, and whoever wins the final wins the Cup.

The idea is to build a website which will attract users who will run World Cup competitions for their friends.
